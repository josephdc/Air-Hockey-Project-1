Game Description:
BATTLESHIP
Is a single player game. The object of the game is to sink all 5 Enemy Ships, which equal 20 squares. As you hit a target you will see the square change to "RED", if you miss a target the square will change to "GREY". 

The left hand column will keep talley of the number of tagets you have hit out of 20 and the number of ships you have sank out of 5. 

Once you sink all 5 ships you will WIN Battleship. 

After a win you refresh the game to play a new battleship round.

Technologies Used:
JavaScript, HTML and CSS 

Design Approach:
The overall design goal was to keep simple, clean and provide a digital conecpt of the traditional game board. I started the design with a background that related most to setting the tone for the game. Next was determining a font heading, this had to be bold and structured enough to flow with the overall concept. Gameboard was the next step... I went with color choice that complimented the background, related to the orginal gameboard concept, yet stood out. Lastly, I created a panel that kept track of the, amount of targets hit verse total targets and the amount of enemy ships sank verse the amount of enemy ships total. 

Unsolved / Adding to project:
There are a few elements I would like to add at a later time... I would like to create background audio and sound effects when the missile lands on a target and when the missile lands in the the water, missing the target.
